# Build My World

[![Udacity - Robotics NanoDegree Program](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-robotics/Extra+Images/RoboND_flag.png)](https://www.udacity.com/robotics)

This is the first project of Udacity's Robotics Software Engineer Nanodegree. I completed it on Gazebo Simulator by using Model Editor and Building Editor. I created a humanoid robot with three joints on each legs and add two of them to the world. I created a building with colored and textured walls. Added windows and doors to the building. Changed the height of walls and size of doors to fit robots. Added cafe tables and ambulance to the world. There is a C++ script to print out welcome message. Here is the picture of my world:
